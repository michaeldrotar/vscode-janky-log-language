# Janky Log Language

The `Log` language and grammar files are a little, well... janky. Let's make things look awesome with proper colors that help more than confuse!

## Inspiration

The default Log grammar files work pretty decently for the built-in logs, but after writing `janky-output-channels` to also apply them to extension logs, some of their issues started to really shine. Other log solutions I've found make pretty logs but they don't apply to the output channels because they create a new log syntax rather than improve the existing one.
